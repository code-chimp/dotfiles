## GNU Emacs 24 Setup

Linux and Windows versions essentially the same except for a line at the top of the Windows init.el that solves a problem CLisp has with Win8 pathing.

First install a Common Lisp - this one uses CLisp, but SBCL works just as well. Setup Lisp support with QuickLisp: http://www.mohiji.org/2011/01/31/modern-common-lisp-on-linux/

Install the following packages via MELPA:

* emmet-mode
* molokai-theme
* monokai-theme
* rainbow-delimiters
